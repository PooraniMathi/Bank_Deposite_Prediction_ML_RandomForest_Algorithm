# Bank Deposit Prediction using Random Forest Classifier
1. Objective:
The objective of this project is to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a bank term deposit based on various demographic and behavioral features. This classification model is built using the Random Forest algorithm, known for its accuracy, robustness, and ability to handle complex datasets.

2. Dataset Description:
The dataset consists of client information collected during a direct marketing campaign by a Portuguese bank. Key features include:
•	Age
•	Job
•	Marital status
•	Education
•	Contact communication type
•	Day and Month of last contact
•	Duration of last contact
•	Previous campaign outcome
•	Balance in the account
•	Target variable: deposit (Yes/No)

3. Libraries Used:
•	pandas
•	numpy
•	matplotlib
•	seaborn
•	scikit-learn

4. Data Preprocessing:
•	Handling missing values (if any)
•	Encoding categorical variables (e.g., job, contact) using One-Hot or Label Encoding
•	Converting the target variable into binary form (Yes = 1, No = 0)
•	Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
•	Understand class imbalance in the target variable
•	Visualize relationships using bar plots and heatmaps
•	Identify key features contributing to customer deposit decisions

6. Model Building
A Random Forest Classifier was implemented using sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.
Key aspects:
•	Combines multiple decision trees
•	Uses bagging (bootstrap aggregation) for better accuracy
•	Handles overfitting better than individual decision trees
Hyperparameters like n_estimators, max_depth, and min_samples_split may have been tuned for better performance.

7. Model Evaluation:
•	Accuracy: Overall prediction correctness
•	Precision: Correct positive predictions
•	Recall: Ability to identify actual positives
•	F1-Score: Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall
•	Confusion Matrix: Distribution of predicted vs actual classes
Cross-validation may have been used to ensure generalization and robustness of the model.

8. Conclusion:
The Random Forest model effectively predicts customer deposit subscriptions by learning patterns in customer behavior and demographics. This predictive model can assist banks in targeting the right customers for marketing campaigns and improving conversion rates.
